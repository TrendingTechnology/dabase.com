If you accidently deselect a bunch of critical packages, and end up practically removing your entire system the you need to quit dselect with a ctrl-C or using ....

Now, if you are really silly, you quit normally then you need to refer to an old backups of your package lists, like so:

diff /var/lib/dpkg/status dpkg.status.0
