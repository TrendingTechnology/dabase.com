A re-occuring problem I have had with computers is encodings.  As an English
speaker I have not need anything except ASCII, but all the same it is annoying
when some text do not look right.

So on my system I have changed some things. My bash locale is now

 hendry@bilbo:/tmp$ printenv | grep -i utf
 LC_ALL=en_GB.UTF-8
 LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
 LC_CTYPE=en_GB.UTF-8

I've added a couple of lines to my editor config .vimrc

 set encoding=utf-8
 set fileencoding=utf-8

And my mailer mutt config .muttrc

 set charset="utf-8"

In Gnome's preferred applications(under desktop preferences -> advanced) for
Terminal I've put

 -u8 -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso10646-1

As xterm's custom terminal exec flag. So Unicode should render properly.

So far so good. Although stange artifacts like rounded brackets appear on my
terminal which usually takes a refresh(ctrl+l) to flush out.
