So, I have unenviable task of moving a VPS from Bitfolk to Linode.

Both run Debian 7 (wheezy).

In an ideal world I could just rsync everything as root. But as this
[resource](http://serverfault.com/a/490077/7798) points out, there are loads of
traps. Many mount points that shouldn't be copied over. Network configurations
and perhaps VPS specific settings that cannot be overwritten.

So the general practice I find is to **rebuild from scratch**. Argh, doing it by hand takes a long time.

Doing it with [Configuration
Management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management#Operating_System_configuration_management)
would be quicker, if you bothered to spend even MORE TIME developing the
recipes to setup the machine. Nevermind the crap load of code that goes into
running Puppet or Ansible and their crazy crazy dependencies.

# User accounts

Used something like [[e/13036]].

Disable password authentication with `PasswordAuthentication No` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

Keep a list of your users ssh public keys online to make things easier, e.g. <http://hendry.iki.fi/hendry.pub>
