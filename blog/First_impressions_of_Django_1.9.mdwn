	~$ python2 -c "import django; print(django.get_version())"
	1.9.2

Using python2.


* [tutorial is good](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/)
* This app within a project, but an app can be in many projects seems a bit wierd.
* Where's the `.gitignore` file and the `Dockerfile`?
* sqlite seems fine, so at what point is it worth taking the leap to postgres? wish it was NoSQL tbh
* manage.py is good. `manage.py runserver` auto-reloading is great. So is the debug. So is the shell.
* admin interface is great, except for that wierd `---------` default action. I hope I can fine tune it though.
* change history in the admin interface is a very welcome surprise. But sadly if the change didn't happen in the admin interface it's not reflected. :(
* the double underscore thing was a bit jarring. 
* following the tutorial, i.e. copying and pasting into vim was a gigantic PITA. there must be a better way.
