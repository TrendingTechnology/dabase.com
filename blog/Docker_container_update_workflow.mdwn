I setup [Greptweet](https://github.com/kaihendry/greptweet) a few months ago on
a <abbr title="Digital Ocean">DO</abbr> "Droplet" aka <abbr title="Virtual
Private Server">VPS</abbr> in London running [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/)
stable.

Over that period of time, there was at least one PHP update (as per bloody usual) and a [cache bugfix](https://github.com/kaihendry/greptweet/issues/52) <a href=https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/539308862461865984>(backstory)</a> I need to rollout.

# How do I test the fix?

This fix was to do with the [nginx.conf](https://github.com/kaihendry/greptweet/blob/master/nginx.conf), not the actual code, so it was easy to build the docker image locally, e.g. `sudo docker build -t g5 .` & `sudo docker run -v /srv/www/greptweet.com:/srv/http/u -p 80:80 -ti g5`

NEED A SOLUTION: What I found difficult to do however, is test any local code
changes, like a Bootstrap update. Since the
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/kaihendry/greptweet/blob/master/Dockerfile)
checks the source code out from git, but I need to **test my working changes**.

# How did I deploy the fix

On my CoreOS droplet, I built a new image with `docker build -t greptweet .`
from a git checkout. I wasn't too sure what was going to happen, since there
was already an image called "greptweet" there and in fact running. The new
build seemed to simply replace that currently running build and all I then
needed to do was `sudo systemctl restart greptweet.service` for the [systemd
service
file](https://github.com/kaihendry/greptweet/blob/master/greptweet.service) to
serve it.

NEED A SOLUTION: Er, so what happened to the old build of Greptweet? Seems to
have disappeared by the build that replaced it. What happens if I want to
downgrade, just `git checkout oldversion` and Docker build from there??
