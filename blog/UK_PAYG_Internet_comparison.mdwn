PAYG Internet charges are coming down. Though they are not as fast as
[HSDPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSPDA) dongle products
[seemingly](http://dabase.com/android/Android_3G_wifi_tethering/), they do
potentially offer great value to get you on the Internet when you're out and
about.

Operators in England seem to go out their way to make this particular product
obscure. Worse is that in some cases, you don't get the special rate unless you
call up in advance and register for it. Very weird. I hope I'm wrong.

I had to spend a lot of time just to find out that:

# Orange

<http://www1.orange.co.uk/service_plans/payasyougo/extra_internet.html>

* £1 bundle, for all day mobile access
* £2.00 daily capped rate, so you never pay more than this a day (contract?)
* £5 for a week of anytime mobile internet access (contract?)

* It's not clear if you have to register in advance for this service or not.
* It's not clear what the usage limit is.
* It's not clear what happens if you exceed the "fair usage limit"

# Vodafone -- Pay as you browse - 25MB

* <http://online.vodafone.co.uk/dispatch/Portal/appmanager/vodafone/wrp?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=templateBlank&pageID=MI_0001>

50p a day

Subject to a 25MB daily data limit.

# O2

[Interesting mail how O2 blocks mobile Internet](http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~rbj/RBJ/usefulstuff/o2mobilewebpaygsetup.html)

# Virgin mobile (uses T-mobile)

<http://www.virginmobilepeople.com/30p/>

30 pence per day for 25M and after than if I understand the pricing correctly,
you're charged at 'normal' rates. Whatever they are.

# Three

<http://www.three.co.uk/Pay_As_You_Go/What_it_costs>

50p per day.
