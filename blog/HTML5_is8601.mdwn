Er, why doesn't HTML5 just use [ISO 8601](http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_widely_used_standards/widely_used_standards_other/date_and_time_format.htm)?

Why the HELL have [they](http://whatwg.org) gone and invented their own [datetime specification](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#valid-date-string)?

Several reasons:

1. ISO8601 does not define how to handle invalid strings
* ISO8601 has insane features likes comments
* Backwards compatibility (existing Web content already uses whitespace instead of "T"
for example)
* ISO8601 actually allows three different forms for the date
