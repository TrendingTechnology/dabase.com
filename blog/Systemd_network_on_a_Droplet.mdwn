From roughly systemd version 210, networking in my Droplet changed.

Out went netctl somehow (good riddance), and my network connectivity.

Use Digital Ocean's buggy Console Access, I managed to setup my network access
manually.

`/etc/network.d/ethernet-static` gave me the clue, to run:

	ip addr add 128.199.252.174/255.255.192.0 dev enp0s3
	ip route add default via 128.199.192.1

And yay! I can ssh in. Now to migrate to
[systemd-networkd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_configuration#systemd-networkd).

I created `/etc/systemd/network/enp0s3.network`:

	[root@sgd ~]# cat /etc/systemd/network/enp0s3.network
	# Migrated from /etc/network.d/ethernet-static
	# https://coreos.com/blog/intro-to-systemd-networkd/
	[Match]
	Name=enp0s3
	[Network]
	Address=128.199.252.174/18
	Gateway=128.199.192.1

1. To test `systemctl start systemd-networkd.service`.
* Check `systemctl status systemd-networkd.service` looks good
* Enable it `systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service`
* And reboot!
