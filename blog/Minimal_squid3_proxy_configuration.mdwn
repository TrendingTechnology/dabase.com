Setting up a proxy might needed to evade censorship and [geo
restrictions](http://dabase.com/e/04052/). Out of my frustration of dealing
with the default configuration, I've spent a good hour or two reducing it to
the ABSOLUTELY minimal configuration possible.

# Install squid3

	sudo apt-get install squid3

# /etc/squid3/squid.conf

	auth_param digest program /usr/lib/squid3/digest_pw_auth -c /etc/squid3/passwords
	auth_param digest realm proxy
	acl authenticated proxy_auth REQUIRED
	http_access allow authenticated
	http_access deny all
	http_port 3128

These 6 lines, sure beat the INSANE 5539 LOC of `squid.conf.dpkg-dist`.

# Setting up a user

	htdigest -c /etc/squid3/passwords proxy user

Drop the `-c` for your subsequent users.

`tail -f /var/log/squid3/access.log` to see who is using your proxy
