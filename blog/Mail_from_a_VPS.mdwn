So I thought it was prude to establish reliable `mail()` functionality from my
various servers I administer.

First step was choose a name of VPS. I chose "rojak".

I setup a domain alias at Fastmail.fm so I can receive the emails to that address.

I then set up <https://aws.amazon.com/ses/> with a [verified
email](http://s.natalian.org/2015-11-10/1447139043_1150x1058.png) so that it
could send as that address.

Caveat: You are only able to send mail to that email address to. So for example
if you had foo@example.com verified, you can only send to and from that
address!

So now I needed a dumb mailer. My new VPS is Fedora 23 and the usual candidates
of [msmtp](http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/) & Debian's
[ssmtp](https://wiki.debian.org/sSMTP).

# /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

	root=foo@example.com
	FromLineOverride=NO
	mailhub=email-smtp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:587
	AuthUser=AKIAINSHZHYMQYHXD4FQ
	AuthPass=secret
	UseSTARTTLS=yes
	UseTLS=YES
	TLS_CA_File=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
	AuthMethod=LOGIN
	Debug=YES

	echo testing | mail -s foobar root
	[root@rojak ssmtp]# send-mail: 554 Transaction failed: Missing final '@domain'

The final line of my `/etc/aliases` says

	root:           foo@example.com

I can see from the debug, it correctly remapping with a test like `echo testing | mail -s postmaster abuse`, e.g.

	Nov 10 07:15:37 rojak sSMTP[8509]: Remapping: "abuse" --> "root"
	Nov 10 07:15:37 rojak sSMTP[8509]: Remapping: "root" --> "foo@example.com"
	Nov 10 07:21:22 rojak sSMTP[8540]: RCPT TO:<foo@example.com>

But still the **To** is:

	Nov 10 07:15:37 rojak sSMTP[8509]: To: abuse

Which is rejected my AWS SES with:

	Nov 10 07:15:38 rojak sSMTP[8509]: 554 Transaction failed: Missing final '@domain'

I wish AWS SES could just use **RCPT TO** here.

# /etc/msmtprc

	defaults
	tls on
	tls_starttls on
	tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
	account default
	host email-smtp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
	port 587
	auth on
	user AKIAINSHZHYMQYHXD4FQ
	password secret
	from foo@example.com

Don't forget the `ln -s /usr/bin/msmtp /usr/sbin/sendmail`

Sadly [msmtp](http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/) is harder to debug and suffers from the same **554 Transaction failed: Missing final '@domain'** issue.

	send-mail: server message: 554 Transaction failed: Missing final '@domain'
	send-mail: could not send mail (account default from /etc/msmtprc)
