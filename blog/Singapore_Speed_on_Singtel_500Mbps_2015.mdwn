I was curious to know if there was a real difference between the **Network Performance** between AWS ap-southeast-1a m3.xlarge (52.74.16.160) and a ap-southeast-1a t2.micro (52.74.13.219).

I configured both instances as 64bit Ubuntu since that has the `iperf` package readily available and on my wired X220 laptop I ran several iperf tests.

Here are some abbreviated typical results:

	x220:~$ for i in 52.74.16.160 52.74.13.219 sgo.webconverger.com sg.webconverger.com; do iperf -c $i; sleep 1; done
	[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec   648 MBytes   543 Mbits/sec
	[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec   601 MBytes   504 Mbits/sec
	[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  64.8 MBytes  54.2 Mbits/sec
	[  3]  0.0-10.1 sec  39.2 MBytes  32.5 Mbits/sec

sgo.webconverger.com is a Singaporean Digital Ocean instance and
sg.webconverger is a Singapore based
[GPLHost](http://www.gplhost.com/gplhost-network-singapore.html) instance. Have
a look at <https://webconverger.org/servers> for details.

# My conclusions

There is no difference in **Network Performance** between the _high_ of
m3.xlarge and _low to medium_ of t2.micro.

Singtel's 500Mbps is actually 500Mbps... in one test it even went as high as
542Mbps.

Digital Ocean and GPLHost seem limited to 100Mbps and 50Mbps respectively.
Though it's highly variable. Suck!
