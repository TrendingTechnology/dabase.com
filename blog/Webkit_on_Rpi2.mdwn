Since creating a [Webconverger Rpi2 port](https://webconverger.org/rpi2/) based
upon [Archlinux-Arm](http://archlinuxarm.org/) I've run into the issue whereby
Webkit2 stops working after an upgrade.

The canonical issue is raised upon
<https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143817>, since the [Archlinux Arm
project say its an upstream
issue](http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=8740&p=46442).

**THE MISSION**: Get Webkit2 working on the [Alarm
Rpi2](http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/broadcom/raspberry-pi-2)!

# Does Webkit2 work on Raspbian? Yes... but

So upon [Webkit2](http://webkitgtk.org/) the Stable tarball is WebKitGTK+
**2.10.3**. Archlinux's [webkit2gtk is good at being
current](https://github.com/archlinuxarm/PKGBUILDs/blob/master/extra/webkit2gtk/PKGBUILD), however Debian's packaging is a bit odd.

Firstly their package is called **libwebkitgtk-3.0-0**. The source package from
where it is built from is confusingly called **webkitgtk** and their current
version at time of writing is **2.4.8-2+rpi1**, which is about 6 months old.

After grabbing the source, you can see a scary amount of patches. [314](http://ix.io/lF0) to be exact.

	pi@raspberrypi ~/webkitgtk-2.4.1/debian/patches/rpi $ ls -1 *.patch | wc -l
	314

So one of these patches probably might make **Webkit2** work on **ARMv7h**.
Well... actually I am not confident at all since I know for a fact
**webkit2gtk-2.6.5-1** works fine in [Webconverger's Rpi2
port](https://webconverger.org/rpi2/), and Raspbian's **heavily patched**
version is _2.4.8_... which is older!

My next step now is to contact <https://www.collabora.com/> since I actually
don't understand where the patches come from. `debian/copyright` or
`debian/source/` didn't yield any clues. I can't see the patches from
<https://git.collabora.com/cgit/raspberry-pi/WebKit.git/>. Maybe I'm blind.

# Building

I don't have a sane build system for **ARMv7h**. I can't try different compiler
flags and what not since my only build system is the embedded board itself
which takes DAYS to build.
