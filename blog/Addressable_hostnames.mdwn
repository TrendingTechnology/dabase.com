Consider:

	[hendry@sg ~]$ hostname
	sg.dabase.com
	[hendry@sg ~]$ logout
	Connection to 128.199.115.232 closed.
	X1C3:~$ hostname
	X1C3

it's simply `sg.dabase.com`.

`X1C3` is my laptop. It's not online all the time. It's usually on a
`192.168.x.x` address inside a NAT. To address it in a LAN it's simply
`X1C3.local` since all the devices on my LAN run
