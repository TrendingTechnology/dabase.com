I upgraded my Mom's old [11 inch Macbook
Air](http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=221470328889) since
she said the screen was too small. Enter a 13-inch, Early 2014 model with OS X
10.9.3 and enter an opportunity for me to test how well Archlinux works on this
gorgeous Apple hardware in the month of June 2014. Yes, I am looking to upgrade
from my Thinkpad X220 and [Lenovo sadness](http://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad).

Firstly I must say, [Archlinux wiki's Macbook
page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook) is a bit of mess. It
over-complicates partitioning and boot loading. However I don't feel like
wading in there to try fix it.

It's surprisingly simple to Archlinux going on the Macbook Air.

1. Boot into OSX. Upgrade.
* Resize the disk using [Disk Utility](http://s.natalian.org/2014-06-21/DiskUtil.png), amazingly you can resize a running MacOSX install
* [Install rEFInd](http://s.natalian.org/2014-06-21/rEFInd.png), with the all drivers switch, `./install.sh --alldrivers`
* Boot the Archlinux ISO on a USB stick by holding down the Alt key
* Fdisk, create a new partition /dev/sda4, mkfs.ext4 format it, mount it and pacstrap the mount
* Reboot and with some luck rEFInd, will pick it up!

# Issues

## TrackPad

I am familiar with the Thinkpad nipple. I'm struggling with the trackpad. I
can't figure out how to paste!!!

## caffeinate

When I close the lid, the Macbook Air goes to sleep. But sometimes it's doing a
long upload or download. I don't know how to keep it awake.
