For the "Brazilian guy in Portugal" case referred to before,                          
this is where LC_* come in; you would set                                             
 LC_MESSAGES=pt_BR                                                                     
 LANG=pt_BR                                                                            
to get Brazilian dialect of Portuguese, and everything else                           
 LC_MONETARY=pt                                                                        
etc.
