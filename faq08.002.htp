What I use to test if a machine *works*, is use Memtest86. Run for a few hours and see what it comes up with. If it comes up clean, then its usuable. Else send it back.

Make a temporary floppy disk for the purpose of testing.

The "badblocks" & "smartmontools" utilities are great for testing hard disks and "memtest86"                                                                                                     
effective at testing memory. The former is included with many distributions                                                                                               
while the latter is available with some disaster recovery                                                                                                kits or from http://www.memtest86.com/
