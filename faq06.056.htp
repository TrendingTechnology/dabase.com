There is a couple of new ways with 2.3:

Otherwise:


    def unique(self, list):                                                                                                                                               
        d = {}                                                                                                                                                            
        for x in list:                                                                                                                                                    
            d[x] = 1                                                                                                                                                      
        subset = d.keys()                                                                                                                                                 
        return subset


Or list comp:
 [x for x in data if data.count(x) == 1] 

Or with sets.
