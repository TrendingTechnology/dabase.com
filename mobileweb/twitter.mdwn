Mobile site - [m.twitter.com](http://m.twitter.com/login)
Desktop site - [twitter.com](http://twitter.com)

# Double authentication

Navigating to m.twitter.com from twitter.com will require you to authenticate
**again**. This is probably because they do not share the same cookie, do to different domains.

# Cookie conundrum

If you start on m.twitter.com then goto the desktop site. A cookie is set so
that even if you are on m.twitter.com, you see the Desktop site. URL integrity
is broken.

# No images on the mobile site

The mobile site is 4kb and has no images, except for mobile.gif.  ~200KB on the
"Standard" Desktop site with all images. Once the images are cached, the
typical payload is 15KB. The CSS is quite complex, though could be a bit more
exciting on the mobile site.

# The update form does not take full width

So this makes the mobile version of the site unpleasant to use from the Desktop.
