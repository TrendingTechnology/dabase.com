My repo has better stuff:

 12:18 < hendry> Could anyone shed some light on a regex problem I have here? http://rafb.net/paste/results/U1015016.html
 12:21 < The-Fixer> (?s.*?)
 12:22 < deltab> hendry: it doesn't work for all the arpagraphs
 12:22 < deltab> ^paragraphs
 12:22 < deltab> only those on one line
 12:25 < deltab> hendry: you need the s option to make . match newlines, as The-Fixer mentions
 12:28 < deltab> hendry: or you can pass the flag to re.search:  re.search('<body>(.*?)</body>', re.S)
 12:28 < deltab> er, with the input too
 12:28 < hendry> thanks, I was trying to figure out this 's' meaning
 12:31 < deltab> it makes . match any character including newlines
 12:31 < deltab> also called re.DOTALL
 12:36 < The-Fixer> you can ignore case also: re.search("(?si)<body>(.*?)</body>", '<BODY>ab\ncd\nef</body>').group(1) #==> 'ab\ncd\nef'
 12:47 < moshez> don't do stupid crap
 12:47 < moshez> like, say, parsing HTML with REs
