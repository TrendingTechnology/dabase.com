Title: 1.17. Backgrounding a process
Say you run a process to check its Stdout debug messages, or you just forget to put the ampersand in after its name, this is how I do about backgrounding it.
 hendry@bilbo:~$ straw
 (straw:4967): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "bluecurve",
 (straw:4967): GLib-GObject-WARNING **:    gobject.c:946:g_object_get_valist(): object class `GnomeProgram' has no property named `default-icon'
 (straw:4967): Gtk-WARNING **: gtkwidget.c:2710: widget `GnomeApp' has no activatable signal "delete_event" without arguments
Now hit CTRL+z
 [1]+  Stopped                 straw
 hendry@bilbo:~$
bg for actually backgrounding the process
 hendry@bilbo:~$ bg
 [1]+ straw &
And finally:
 hendry@bilbo:~$ disown
In order to make sure the process survives if I decide to kill the xterm it was launched in!
