Title: 1.10. Recording console sessions
Want to show someone your work? Use script. It annoyingly has all your errors and frantic backspaces, however I at least find it beneficial.
script mywork
and ctrl-d or exit stops it recording.
history is another command I run very often, try it.
You can also harcopy sessions with `screen`.
