# Video

Best way is to use the package
[recordmydesktop](http://packages.qa.debian.org/r/recordmydesktop.html) and
upload the video to YouTube or something!

Want to show someone your work? Try `script`. It annoyingly has all your errors
and frantic backspaces, however I at least find it beneficial.

script mywork
and ctrl-d or exit stops it recording.

History is another command I run very often, try it.

You can also hardcopy sessions with `screen`.
