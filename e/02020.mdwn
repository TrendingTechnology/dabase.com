[[!meta title="Could not copy message"]]

If you get "Could not copy message" or "Can't open PGP subprocess!: No such
file or directory (errno = 2)", it means your mutt and GPG are not configured
to work with another.

The solution is to source from your ~/.muttrc a mutt/gpg configuration usually
in your mutt package. On Archlinux add to your ~/.muttrc:

	source /etc/Muttrc.gpg.dist
