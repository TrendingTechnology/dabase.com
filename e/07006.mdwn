Firstly:
 apt-get install vim-python
for Vi IMproved, with python scripting support
hello.py:
 import vim
 count = 0
 for b in vim.buffers:
         print "Length of buffer %s: %s" % (count, len(b))
         count = count + 1
 vim.command("help python")
In vim:
 :pyfile hello.py
Or you could just run command after command, like:
 :python import vim
Er, check the docs
 :help python
