[[!meta title="Getting port numbers out of /etc/service"]]
There is usually a couple of ways:

	15:14 < hendry> gnychis: tail /etc/services | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F / '{print $1}'

	15:18 < m4n> gnychis: while read line; do line="${line%/*}"; echo "${line##* }"; done < yourfile
Though the second one is a bashism.
