[[meta title="Shell CGI"]]

For simple scripts shell is pretty good. You have the permission problems to
deal with. The Apache2 configuration with .htaccess is straight forward:

	Options +ExecCGI
	AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

The important element to shell CGI scripts in to ensure you have "Content-Type:
text/html" in there with a couple of carriage returns.

	#!/bin/sh

	title="Shell CGI"

	cat <<END
	Cache-Control: no-cache
	Content-Type: text/html

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<meta charset="utf-8" />
			<title>$title</title>
		</head>
	<body>
	<pre>
	END

	wget http://webconverger.com/flower100.png &> /dev/stdout || echo "Permission denied"
	env

	cat <<END
	</pre>
	</body>
	</html>
	END

`/dev/stderr` outputs to `/var/log/apache2/error.log` so you need redirect `wget` output to stdout as I do in this case.
