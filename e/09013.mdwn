[[!meta title="Howto send a PATCH from git"]]

Clone the master. Make the change, commit.

    git-format-patch "HEAD^"

or rather

	git format-patch origin

    git-send-email 0001-

Caveat: 'format-patch' doesn't handle revision range expressions
in normal manner.  if you provide a _single_ revision, it is the
same as if you appended ".."
