[[meta title="Finding .svn"]]
Grep is practical:

	find . -type f | fgrep -v /.svn/

	find .|grep -v .svn
Though it can be done entirely in find:

	find . -type f -a ! -path '*/.svn/*'
Nuking .svn directories might work like so:

	find . -name .svn -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;

Oops DUPED in [[e/01075]]

Btw, don't forget about the command:

	svn export
