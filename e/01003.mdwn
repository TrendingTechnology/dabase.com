Title: 1.3. Showing friends and family GNU/Linux
Convincing people to make the switch is pretty damn difficult. However I can suggest you use a Live Linux filesystem distro such as :
Knoppix - http://www.knoppix.net/
Gnoppix - http://www.gnoppix.org
Morphix - http://www.morphix.org
To show them. It does not touch their hard drive, so they have nothing to fear. And they can sit back and play around with linux. It is also a good indicator to see if the NIC or modem will work etc. etc.
