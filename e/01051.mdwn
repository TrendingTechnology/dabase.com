Well, tonight I was wondering how to play a .wav file from the command line.
There is sox of course:

	sox chat1.wav -t ossdsp -w -s /dev/dsp
Nasty...
Then part on #debian-fi pointed me out:

	see
Which from the manpage:


	run-mailcap, see, edit, compose, print - execute programs via entries in the mailcap file
Very cool...
