Title: 1.11. Writing CDs (Backing up your Mail)
I never ever remember this. So here I am recording the information about burning CDs with :
 mkisofs -o /tmp/backup.iso .
 cdrecord -scanbus
 cdrecord -v speed=12 dev=0,0,0 -data /tmp/backup.iso
I back up my mail every so often. I generally keep my mail. My last backup of mail was 50 megs, compressed! GULP.
 tar cvf backup.tar Mail/
 bzip2 backup.tar
Encrypting my mail:
 gpg -e -r hendry backup.tar.bz2
To decrypt, word of advice, do not use gpg -d, just use:
 gpg backup.tar.bz2.gpg
