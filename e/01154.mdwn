Record voice to WAV, then encode to MP3
http://www.togaware.com/linux/survivor/Command_Line.html

	sound-recorder -P recording.wav

or perhaps:

	arecord -d 10 -f cd -t wav foobar.wav

To playback:

	aplay recording.wav

Troubleshoot with alsamixer and perhaps Skype to check your mic settings. You shouldn't require mic boost btw.
You probably want to look at debian multimedia:
http://www.debian-multimedia.org/dists/unstable/main/binary-i386/
And add their repo to your sources.list
To encode WAV to MP3, use lame from the debian-multimedia repositry.
For video, record to oggtheora. Encode to OGG using ffmpeg2theora. An [upload script example](http://svn.natalian.org/projects/static/up.sh).

To record a screencast, see:

	recordmydesktop

For OGG playback, mplayer.
