Title: 1.2. Installing debian without CDs or boot floppies
A pleasant way of installing debian is by putting a friend's hard drive in your machine and using debootstrap described in :
http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch-preparing.en.html#s-linux-upgrade
An operation like :
/usr/sbin/debootstrap --arch i386 woody /mnt/debinst
http://ftp.fi.debian.org/debian
It just cool... :) No need for downloading .isos etc. Perfect if the friend's machine does not have a floppy/cd drive too.
