[[meta title="Make development cycles in C/C++"]]

Write a Makefile. Call it with:

	:make

Then view your compilation results with

	:cope

From this window you can select the error from something that's related to vim's quicklist. Awesome eh?

Also try:

	:clist

I often mis-remember `cope` as `scope`.

	:help quickfix
