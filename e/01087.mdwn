[[!meta title="SMTP via SSH"]]

SMTP is often blocked at ISPs to prevent spammers.
Use mutt and a shell script with this [[tip|e/01013]].

	frodo$ cat server.soltecsoftware.com.au-sendmail
	#!/bin/sh
	ssh server.soltecsoftware.com.au /usr/sbin/sendmail "$@"

Now configure [mutt MUA](http://www.mutt.org/) to use your own MTA hack:

	frodo$ egrep sendmail .muttrc
	set sendmail = "/home/hendry/server.soltecsoftware.com.au-sendmail"
