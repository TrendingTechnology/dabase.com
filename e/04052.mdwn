[[!meta title="Proxying around BBC Iplayer geo restrictions"]]

Ask for the foreign user wanting to access BBC Iplayer content abroad for their
IP (foreign IP).  <http://www.whatismyip.com/> is probably easiest.

Get a VPS in the UK. I recommend <http://bitfolk.com/> or <http://www.bytemark.co.uk/>

Use Debian and [squid3](http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/squid3.html).

`sudo vim /etc/squid3/squid.conf` and add the foreign IP (example uses
121.121.121.121) like so:

	acl localhost src 121.121.121.121

`sudo /etc/init.d/squid3 restart` and `tail -f /var/log/squid3/access.log`

## Configuring the foreign user's browser

In Firefox, find the proxy configuration tab and enter the IP of the server.

Ask user to access a site and track `tail -f /var/log/squid3/access.log` to make sure it works.
