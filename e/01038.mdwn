Some tips I've collected...

    export EMAIL="your@email.org"
    sudo apt-get build-dep packaganame
    apt-get install devscripts
    debuild -uc -us

'-' before shell command well make it return a non-error even in the command fails. Or:

    shell-command || true

does the job, and is more readable.
