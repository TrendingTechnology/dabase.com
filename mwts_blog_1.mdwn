What's measured improves.

			- [Peter Drucker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker)

The mobile Web needs to improve. Tests like the WCT are designed to measure the
Web interoperability of the mobile browser. The
[Acid2](http://www.webstandards.org/files/acid2/test.html#top) &
[Acid3](http://acid3.acidtests.org/) tests are similar metrics that do not
focus on mobiles, like the MWT does.

The [WCT manifesto](http://www.w3.org/2008/06/mobile-test/doc.html) details
tests that the [MWTS group openly decided were
important](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-mwts/) for mobile
browsers to support. Briefly:

1. Useful CSS function for smaller screens
* Good graphics support is the cornerstone of the Web
* Compression saves money on typical mobile data plans
* HTTPS has been a problem area on mobile browsers
* So too have been cookies
* Interesting to know if XHTML is supported for legacy applications
* Good to have Web 2.0 AJAX applications working
* **Scalable* Graphics are of special relevance to mobile screens
* CSS media queries is how author should adapt content if they require
* Inputmode tests for a form feature to enter number easily
* Dynamic *scalable* graphics is also great to have
* Test for typical problem area of IDNs
* Testing for events
* Canvas helps enables games on mobiles
* Contenteditable allows in line editing, which might help content generation
* Power CSS3 selectors allow flexibilty for style sheets

Some of these tests might not be relevant any more and could be dropped. And
likewise new tests can be added. We are open to suggestions!

Notice how the test indicates with a green square if the test passes. Unlike
the Acid tests, we hope to quickly demonstrate from a mobile browser the
quality of the browser.  The tests have been ordered relatively in order of
difficulty. However we believe it is fair to say in our experience, the more
green squares the better.

Unfortunately since many mobile browser Javascript engines are fairly limited
we have not currently added a percentage counter like Acid3. However please
feel free to measure how well your device does.

For example my current mobile phone, the G1 "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android
1.0; en-gb; dream) AppleWebKit/525.10+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0.4 Mobile
Safari/523.12.2" gets 9/16 on version 1.42 of the test. Please ensure you have
the UA string, version of the test alongside your score.

I hope it improves like the new 2.2 firmware of the Iphone boasting 12/16.

However there are many more mobiles that can't even reach the WCT in order
measure how well it performs on the Web! So just by visiting the WCT you are on
the right road to improving the Web.

Share the score and together lets realise the mobile Web.
