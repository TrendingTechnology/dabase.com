You may need to need FLUSH i.e. clear what configuration you have (iptables -L to see) with iptables -F I recall, before you begin. You can just drop off the internet if you afraid at this point and reconnect when you are happy with the iptables -L listing.

Create the 'block chain':
 iptables -N block

Make sure that your connections work:
 iptables -A block -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
Everything not through ppp0 (i.e. LAN) is accepted and not filtered
 iptables -A block -m state --state NEW -i ! ppp0 -j ACCEPT
Else block block block !!! :)
 iptables -A block -j DROP
 iptables -A INPUT -j block
 iptables -A FORWARD -j block

See what your setup it now.
 iptables -L

Ok, lets accept SSH. :)
 iptables -I block -i ppp0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
 iptables -L

Lets save it so when we reboot it should get re-configured.
 /etc/init.d/iptables save_active

If I want to add a rule, say to let people connect to my web server:

 iptables -I block -i ppp0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
 
Here is what my iptables -L listing looks like currently:
 bilbo:/home/hendry# iptables -L
 Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
 target     prot opt source               destination         
 block      all  --  anywhere             anywhere           
 
 Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
 target     prot opt source               destination         
 block      all  --  anywhere             anywhere           
 
 Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
 target     prot opt source               destination         
 

 Chain block (2 references)
 target     prot opt source               destination         
 ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere           tcp dpt:www 
 ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere           tcp dpt:ircd 
 ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere           tcp dpt:2234 
 ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere           tcp dpt:ssh 
 ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere           state  RELATED,ESTABLISHED 
 ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere           state NEW 
 DROP       all  --  anywhere             anywhere

2234 is for soulseek.


The iptables init.d script is no longer. So here is how I configured my firewall in /etc/network/interfaces:

 iface lo inet loopback

 auto eth0
 iface eth0 inet dhcp
        pre-up echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        pre-up iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $IFACE -j MASQUERADE
        pre-up iptables -N block
        pre-up iptables -A block -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
        pre-up iptables -A block -m state --state NEW -i ! eth0 -j ACCEPT
        pre-up iptables -A block -j DROP
        pre-up iptables -A INPUT -j block
        pre-up iptables -A FORWARD -j block
        pre-up iptables -I block -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
        pre-up iptables -I block -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

 auto eth1
 iface eth1 inet static
        address 192.168.0.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0


Please note my Internet connection is via eth0 now, not ppp0! The eth1 is for serving my NAT. See:
