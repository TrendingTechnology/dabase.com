Customer service by telephone sucks.

Telephone communication is intrusive and wasteful. What happens if you are:

* on hold?
* trying to navigate their absurd menu when really they should have provided a dedicated number
* trying to do some work whilst resolving this matter
* trying to resolve the matters out of hours
* trying not to disturb your co-workers
* trying to talk to someone who can clearly speak English
* have a poor mobile connection that's both bad quality and very expensive to call 'Toll free' & Low call numbers

Compared to email, where you can make your complaint in your own time and convenience whilst making sure all your points of concern are clearly noted.

In years past, we complained by letter. If it was a serious matter, a photocopy
would have been made. Perhaps the letter was sent registered to ensure the
recipient did receive it. A fax would have done both the copy and the
verification quite sufficiently.

Today a plethora of telephone call centres are deployed by the industry to
serve you the customer. Whilst communication with the customer is often far
quicker and convenient over the telephone, there is no transcript and therefore
no accountability.

With no copy of the communication that you had in the past with a letter or fax
you have no recourse in a court of law.

A low paid call centre teleworker ('droid) can swindle you, mislead you and you
will have no way to prove this. Even if you were informed, you can not use this
information seriously anywhere.

So when companies such as 3 or Virgin Media only want to communicate with you
via voice, I'm deeply concerned. It's a disgrace that UK's biggest ISP does not
permit email correspondence with their customers.
