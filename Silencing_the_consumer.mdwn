Companies which you can't email effectively are violating your right to speak out.

In years past, in order to complain we sent a letter. If it was a serious
matter, a photocopy would have been made. Perhaps the letter was sent
registered to ensure the recipient did receive it. A fax would have done both
the copy and the verification quite sufficiently.

Today toll free telephone call centres are deployed by the industry to serve
you the customer. Whilst communication with the customer is often far quicker
and convenient over the telephone, there is no transcript.

With no copy of the communication that you had in the past with a letter or fax
you have no recourse in a court of law.

A call centre teleworker can swindle you, mislead you and you will have no way
to prove this. Even if you were informed, you can not use this information
seriously anywhere.

So when companies such as 3 or Virgin Media only want to communicate with you
via voice, I'm deeply concerned. It's a disgrace that UK's biggest ISP does not
permit email correspondence with their customers.

Otelo an ombudsmen to mediate disputes between you the consumer and a
telecommunications company does do email... in PDF. Which is absolutely
ridiculous. PDF has nothing to do with email standards and it makes it
impossible to reply in context to their static PDF content if your email client
manages to display a proprietary non-standard document format.

Telephone communication is intrusive. What happens when you're
* on hold?
* trying to do some work
* trying to resolve the matters out of hours
* trying to talk to someone who can clearly speak English

Demand email correspondence. Write a letter asking for an email address.
