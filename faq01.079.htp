Add another file in the router directory for catchall to work.

 hendry@bilbo:/etc/exim4/conf.d/router$ cat 950_exim4-config_catchall 
 catch_all:                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
   debug_print = "R: catch_all for $local_part@$domain"

   data = ${lookup{*}lsearch{/etc/aliases}}

 hendry@bilbo:/etc/exim4/conf.d/router$ egrep hendry /etc/aliases 
 root: hendry
 *: hendry

With other people. I have yet to figure out how to configure different aliases for different hosts, but I am not worried about that problem atm.
