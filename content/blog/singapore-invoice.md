This is not an atypical payment request from an enrichment class:

What could be better here?

1. Due date could be better advertised
2. No way to quickly pay the invoice via a link that includes the reference. (Not sure if via Paynow (QR code) supports reference.)
3. Total includes late fee. Am I already late? Huh?
4. No way of me knowing if I have already paid this amount (assuming I forgot the next step)
5. Expects a reply telling them the date of the transfer
