Thanks to a prod by the [esteemed
@cheeaun](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/1232658527572774912), I am
collecting country specific Websites that communicate the ["Wuhan" Coronavirus
Outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_outbreak) to their local populace.

I'm using ğŸ‘® to indicate the site I believe to be an official respective
government site. Not easy to tell sometimes.

My goal is to capture the nuances in the information delivery between each
country's **COVID-19 tracker** ğŸ“Š.
