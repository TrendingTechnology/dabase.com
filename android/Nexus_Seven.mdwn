So it's [[four_years|The_deprecated_SDcard]] since my last Android post. Ever
since I was given a "free" iPhone from my workplace at the time, all those years
ago, I decided to switch to IOS and I've been a happy camper ever since.

As people will testify who know me, I not an Android fan. Usability is poor and
I'm a Java hater. Nonetheless I've set myself a challenge to explore & develop
a Webconverger port. The source code won't be public, though I will make
efforts to document my efforts here.

I want **Android 5** and I need a device. If my memory at Aplix serves me
correctly, running AVD emulator on my aging X220 would be madness.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16254776355" title="Nexus 7 running lollipop aka Android 5 by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8661/16254776355_2bd458127b_n.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="Nexus 7 running lollipop aka Android 5"></a>

So I bought a second hand Nexus 7 for 200SGD off <https://carousell.co/>.

First impressions of setting up the device is that the wireless "password" prompt is jarringly wrapped. UGLY!

It seems the device is unusable without logging into Google. Tbh I don't use
Gmail anymore and I don't want it to download my old email, nonetheless it went
ahead and did it. :( I'm logged into Youtube, but it seems like I need to
separately log into the Play store et al. What the hell!?

Not sure how I would ever use this device myself in my daily life. Ok, maybe
for watching Youtube videos in bed? :)

So far nothing impresses me about the device. I thought there was a VOIP
client, but I can't find it. Seems like I have to use the [proprietary Google
Hangout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Hangouts).

I've earmarked today to setup the [Android development environment on
Archlinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/android#Android_Studio). Bonus
points if I manage a Hello World app.

Got android-studio installed after enabling multilib. Why is it 32 bit is beyond me. Especially considering the RAM it consumes.

	Optional dependencies for android-studio
		android-sdk
		android-sdk-platform-tools
		android-sdk-build-tools

<https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/43418?project=1&cat%5B0%5D=2&string=java-runtime-common>

I had some corrupt JDK since I ran out of disk space on /tmp, hence [I wasted some time](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/43418?project=1&cat%5B0%5D=2&string=java-runtime-common). OpenJDK was unstable with crap outs like `systemd-coredump[20156]: Process 7039 (java) of user 1000 dumped core`. The Oracle JDK works better since I think it's compiled against a newer libc from what I was reading after a frantic Google session.

	x220:~$ sudo archlinux-java status
	Available Java environments:
	  java-8-jdk (default)
	  java-8-jre/jre
	  java-8-openjdk

Worryingly, selecting to create a new project takes seriously 5 minutes of frantic downloading. Scary: <http://r2d2.webconverger.org/2015-01-12/gradle.mp4>

Android studio seems to going mental with "Unregistered Vcs root detected" with
the fact the my homedir is in Git. Configure doesn't seem to point out where my
Project lives. I think I've resolved this now.

Both `wmname LG3D` and `export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1` seems to be
needed to make android-studio behave with [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/).

Things I don't understand about IntelliJ. How to reformat buffer? Why is
finding a class so bloody slow? How do I search all the files in a project?

Not sure how Android documentation is organised. Took me hours to find:

<http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.html#isInLockTaskMode()> was the way you test <http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#startLockTask()> is active. Why isn't there a cross reference?

Furthermore, to be able to query this property, you need to quite a length
instantiation: `ActivityManager activityManager = (ActivityManager)
this.getSystemService(Context.ACTIVITY_SERVICE);`

Creating a URL in Java is a bit weird. Seems to bizarrely demand a try..catch.

So bundles, IIUC, are Android's version of [localStorage](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#the-localstorage-attribute)?

### WebView

Why doesn't it prompt that it needs the **android.permission.INTERNET** permission in the IDE?

Odd how you need to explicitly enable Javascript and make links clickable.

Odd to me, that `loadUrl` wants a string, not a URL object.

I wish there was a way taking a video capture like you can with IOS attached to
a MBP with Quicktime player "Movie recording".
