On the machine you want to clone:
 dpkg --get-selections > selections.txt

On the destination machine:
 dpkg --set-selections < selections.txt
 aptitude

Some rsync commands to follow:

 debian:~# rsync -essh -rtpvz / root@192.168.0.141:/

ARGH! NOOOO. Does not work. Tries to do DUMB things like copy /proc and ./mnt

 debian:~# rsync -essh -rtpvz /etc root@192.168.0.141:/etc

Doesn't work for some reason...
