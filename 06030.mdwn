I generally need these two lines when I begin writing a script:

 #!/usr/bin/env python2                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 if __name__ == '__main__':


IF the #! does not work, your file is probably encoded in a DOS format!
Fix it in vim with:


 :se ff=unix  
 
 

(Thanks to Wari for pointing that out to me)
