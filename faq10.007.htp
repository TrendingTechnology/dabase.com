Usually your school or research organization gives you a .bst file to work with. e.g. tktl.bst

This has the styles you need to work with in some sort of functional bibtex language.

I was looking for something to give attribution or cite material like W3C specs on the web. THANKFULLY there was something in tktl.bst that does it, as the latex defaults I don't think cut it.

In my bst my favourite is @www-inproceedings.

You could write a bst yourself, but I am sure that is probably not a good idea.

When compiling your tex look closely for warnings. Sort them out.
