Record voice to WAV, then encode to MP3

http://www.togaware.com/linux/survivor/Command_Line.html

 sound-recorder -P recording.wav

or perhaps:

 arecord -d 10 -f cd -t wav foobar.wav

To playback:

 aplay recording.wav

Troubleshoot with alsamixer and perhaps Skype to check your mic settings. You shouldn't require mic boost btw.

You probably want to look at debian multimedia:

http://www.debian-multimedia.org/dists/unstable/main/binary-i386/

And add their repo to your sources.list

To encode WAV to MP3, use lame from the debian-multimedia repositry.

For video, record to oggtheora. Encode to OGG using ffmpeg2theora. An upload script example:
http://svn.natalian.org/projects/static/up.sh


To record a screencast, see:

 recordmydesktop

For OGG playback, mplayer.
