Limit the list of displayed e-mails in a mail folder to those with a "string" in their body:

 l ~b "string"

BUT it does involve having all the mails. So if you use a remote IMAP, not such a good idea.

IDEALY your IMAP server should implement SEARCH.
See page 37 of:
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2060.txt

For my mail that I dump to my fs ~/Mail, I use :
http://www.rrbcurnow.freeuk.com/mairix/

To index and search them.
