# Title is redudant

* HTML title's get buried in iframes and like it or not this is how a lot of mashups will work (sandboxing)
* Titles often maintain identity. This is better done by URL domain names.
* HTML titles should instead be a heading **h1**. This is very often the case already.

# http:// is redundant

URL links should not promote typing of http://.

It's **seven** unneccessary characters which really harms the take up of the mobile Web.

UA should check for HTTPS site first, before redirecting to http://

# www. prefix is redundant

Purists can use CNAMES.

Typing these **four** extra characters harms the mobile Web!

# Maintain URL integrity (including HTTPS!!!)

Entering https://paypal.co.uk into a mobile Android browser should take you to
a secure payment site.

What happens currently is that Paypal UA sniffs the mobile UA and redirects you
to an unsecured http://paypal.co.uk/m. Attackers can exploit this by
overriding UA strings so that Web sites use insecure connections.

# The HTTPS takes up room

Use a gold bar like Firefox does already.

# Fix dot com

Far too many useful dotcom domains are squatted upon. This is rediculous and
greedy. We need a bigger namespace, however without promoting fragmentation,
like the device specific dotMobi TLD.
