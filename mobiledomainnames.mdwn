# Maintain URL integrity (including HTTPS!!!)

Entering https://paypal.co.uk into a mobile Android browser should take you to
a secure payment site.

What happens currently is that Paypal UA sniffs the mobile UA and redirects you
to an unsecured http://paypal.co.uk/m. Attackers can exploit this by
overriding UA strings so that Web sites use insecure connections.

When you do log in to Paypal, it does redirect you again to HTTPS, though this
is confusing. Maintain the **SSL protocol**.

# Maintain wildcard HTTPS certificates

Some sites like paypal.co.uk only have a valid certificate for **www.paypal.co.uk**.

Hence a dangerous mess if someone goes to https://paypal.co.uk from any device.

# Title is redudant

* HTML title's get buried in iframes and like it or not this is how a lot of mashups will work (sandboxing)
* Titles often maintain identity. This is better done by URL domain names.
* HTML titles should instead be a heading **h1**. This is very often the case already.

# http:// is redundant

URL links should not promote typing of http://.

It's **seven** unnecessary characters which really harms the take up of the mobile Web.

UAs will take users to an unsecured http:// domain.

UA should check for HTTPS site first, before redirecting to http://

# www. prefix is redundant

Purists can use CNAMES.

Typing these **four** extra characters harms the mobile Web!

# The HTTPS padlock takes up room

I suggest using a gold or [green](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/3176790336/) bar like Firefox does already.

# Fix dot com

Far too many useful dotcom domains are squatted upon. This is ridiculous and
greedy. We need a bigger namespace, however without promoting fragmentation,
like the device specific dotMobi TLD.

If the domain is not in use, it should be thrown back into the pool.

Domain names need to become much shorter, to make them usable on the mobileWeb.

Proper Unicode with IRNs will ease the situation, but it's still really really
bad.

# Search is a dangerous form of identity

One can argue the mess with domain names is largely solved by **URL search**.

Search is more usable than domain URLs, but people must know the risks and
clearly be shown the resulting URLs by UAs.

Google is essentially an identity broker.

Want to become the domain for when someone enters "Paypal" into the URL bar?
Pay Google for it and it could likely be the case.
