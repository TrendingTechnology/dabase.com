Well, tonight I was wondering how to play a .wav file from the command line.

There is sox of course:

 sox chat1.wav -t ossdsp -w -s /dev/dsp

Nasty...

Then part on #debian-fi pointed me out:

 see

Which from the manpage:
 
 run-mailcap, see, edit, compose, print - execute programs via entries in the mailcap file

Very cool...
