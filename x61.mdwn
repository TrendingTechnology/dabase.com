# Debian Unstable on a Lenovo [Thinkpad X61](http://thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X61)

by [Kai Hendry](http://hendry.iki.fi/) (any tips **please** get in touch)

> Overall I think the X series is the best laptop to run Debian on, despite my following complaints =)

# Install

## via USB

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2817912921/" title="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=401832 by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3083/2817912921_58ebd4f5db_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=401832" /></a>

Unfortunately the new X61 with the [Debian installer from a USB
stick](http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch04s04.html.en) failed to
work with the **Boot error** message. I did test the d-i USB stick with a
friend's Compaq. On the Compaq the USB installer works, however further testing
showed the USB stick does not work with my older X40 Thinkpad. So I suspect an
[odd bug](http://bugs.debian.org/401832) with Debian install USB images with
(my) Thinkpads.  USB sticks created with [Debian
Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) are fine with my Thinkpads.

## via [Goodbye Microsoft](http://goodbye-microsoft.com/)

So unfortunately I had to waste a few hours of my life installing the OEM
pre-install of Microsoft Vista. Vista ran painfully slowly on 1G of RAM and
there are tons of retarded 3rd party applications that I assume Lenovo put on
there.  However once Vista booted, the win32 debian installer that is [Goodbye
Microsoft](http://goodbye-microsoft.com/) works well. However you must run
`cmd` as Administrator and [alter the boot
timeout](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms791525.aspx), before trying
to reboot into the Debian Installer. Otherwise you will not be able to choose
the Debian installer and you'll reboot into Vista again!

## Initial Debian install

I installed etch and then immediately switched my
[sources.list](http://svn.natalian.org/debian/configuration/x61/sources.list)
to unstable. I started the install in the USA and finished in the UK, hence I
needed the `sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata` command to setup the timezone.

I think I did try LVM with Debian Etch installer, but it did not work. :/

## via PXE (finally!)

Painfully I re-installed my X61 to 686 (from amd64) with LVM using the very
[latest Debian installer](http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). You
might find this [network TFTP boot
guide](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/Creating_a_Test_environment)
helpful. :)

## :r !cat /proc/cpuinfo

`top` does not show them as two seperate processors. So I am wondering how the
processing actually works. When I compile WebKit the `cc1plus` process only
seems to take 30-odd percent of the CPU on `top`. I'm very confused.

Speed stepping does seem to work. It seems to drop down to 800/2001 mhz in
normal use.

## :r !free -m

Since the [X61 I bought from
Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834146336) only
had 1G of memory, I wanted **more**. Armed with the [memory information of the
X61](http://thinkwiki.org/wiki/PC2-5300) I went to Frys in Palo Alto (thanks
Paul from ACOA for the ride!) for the upgrade. I bought a single 2G RAM module
and removed the two 512mb modules. Frys staff were kind enough to borrow me a
small [philips screw driver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_F._Phillips) for me to perform the upgrade then and there.

                 total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
    Mem:          2006       1611        395          0         77       1170
    -/+ buffers/cache:        364       1642
    Swap:         2827          0       2827

I didn't try, but I suspect another 2G module could bring the machine to 4G. I
should also try putting in one of the 512mb modules I took out.

I wish the thinkpad was sold with a RAM module socket for upgrades. I guess
Lenovo save money by using 512mb modules for fulfilling orders.

# Problems and solutions

## "Low Battery Alarm" fails

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2869242637/" title="Beep when you're low by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3282/2869242637_bbd14b1a71_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Beep when you're low" /></a>

Though:

	x61:~% cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/alarm
	alarm:                   3604 mWh

And the **[BIOS](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/2869242637/) is correctly set**. There is no _audible alarm_ like that of my
Thinkpad X40 that the battery is running low. I don't notice the visual battery
indicator in the status bar. :(

## Microphone capture doesn't work (solved)

You need to setup the capture devices with `alsamixer -V capture`. See not notes on:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2315742635/" title="`alsamixer -V capture` by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3296/2315742635_313552427f_m.jpg" width="192" height="240" alt="`alsamixer -V capture`" /></a>

Btw to configure sound output with the correct kernel modules, that's easy with:

    x61:~% sudo alsaconf

## After a day sound playback becomes unbearably choppy

* [sample](http://static.natalian.org/2008-08-11/x61_snd.mp3)

Using 2.6.26-1-686 and ALSA 1.0.16.

This is really irritating.

## SIM card slot mystery

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2165963688/" title="Sim slot on a Thinkpad by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2060/2165963688_85d2f5806a_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Sim slot on a Thinkpad" /></a>

Why the mystery? I want to know how to access my SIM card! Any ideas? Right now I am quite happy accessing Internet via bluetooth mind ... I don't want one SIM card for my Lenovo and another for my phone. That's going to probably be expensive...

## X61 backlight does not work (solved)

Use [`xbacklight`](http://www.lesswatts.org/tips/graphics.php) as of version 7.3 of X.org.

	/usr/bin/xbacklight -set 100%

I'm a little confused now how this relates to brightness. :)

## Think keys don't work

Keys like the volume buttons, brightness and suspend Fn keys don't work. There
does seem to be some ongoing work on the [ibm-acpi-devel -- ibm-acpi Linux
driver
development](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ibm-acpi-devel).

## X doesn't work with Intel (solved)

[Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100](http://thinkwiki.org/wiki/Intel_Graphics_Media_Accelerator_X3100)

Used VESA driver instead initially. Something to do with agpart missing.

Later I tried the reconfiguring X again `sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg` and the Intel driver decided to work.

    Dec 21 00:54:32 x61 kernel: [drm] Initialized drm 1.1.0 20060810
    Dec 21 00:54:32 x61 kernel: [drm] Initialized i915 1.6.0 20060119 on minor 0

`glxgears` seems to run slow, but returns output like:

    883 frames in 5.2 seconds = 169.373 FPS
    840 frames in 5.2 seconds = 161.166 FPS
    840 frames in 5.2 seconds = 160.245 FPS

Bit odd?

## Wireless does not work (semi-solved)

I have this [03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection [8086:4227] (rev 02)](http://thinkwiki.org/wiki/Intel_PRO/Wireless_3945ABG_Mini-PCI_Express_Adapter)
device. Annoyingly there are several ways to drive this device. I've gone for
the most recent kernel and the
[firmware-iwlwifi](http://packages.qa.debian.org/f/firmware-nonfree.html).
[firmware-ipw3945](http://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=firmware-nonfree)
seems to be more popular, though 'iwlwifi' seems to work for me:

    x61:~% dmesg | grep 3945
    iwl3945: Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG/BG Network Connection driver for Linux, 0.1.15ks
    iwl3945: Copyright(c) 2003-2007 Intel Corporation
    iwl3945: Detected Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection
    iwl3945: Tunable channels: 11 802.11bg, 13 802.11a channels
    wmaster0: Selected rate control algorithm 'iwl-3945-rs'

`ifconfig -a` might show the wlan0 interface name screwed up (esp. if you
upgraded from Debian etch to unstable). I used the fix in the [Debian Wiki's
iwlwifi page](http://wiki.debian.org/iwlwifi) with the help of #debian-boot
people.

Currently it can join a [WPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access) secured network fine, but it can't join a very ordinary WEP secured network, with the error:

    mismatch in privacy configuration and mixed-cell disabled - abort association

* Ensure you have the [wpasupplicant](http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wpasupplicant.html) package installed

* `sudo wpa_cli` to manage wireless networks

The X61 wireless interface sadly seems rather inflexible like my X40. You have
to **reboot** the machine to join a new network once you've associated with a
network beforehand. In my experience this a typical problem with linux &
wireless devices. I assume wireless devices are deliberately cripled by
hardware vendors and their firmware to prevent 'hackers' from scanning wireless
networks and breaking any radio laws.

When things go well you'll see:

The iwlwifi seems generally quite unstable. :(  I've heard of people removing
the intel wireless and replacing it with a better [atheros](http://www.atheros.com/) based mini-pci
device. Or perhaps resorting to the earlier driver ... :(

## Fan is always on (solved)

> The fact of the matter is that the Thinkpad X61 **runs hot** (bad Lenovo design), so you'll probably
need the fan even whilst the machine is idle or off mains. :(

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2126792512/" title="Controlling fan noise by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2352/2126792512_7671b52476_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Controlling fan noise" /></a>

From 2.6.23+ the kernel module 'thinkpad\_acpi' supersedes 'ibm\_acpi'.

If you get "bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument" error message you are
missing "experimental=1 fan_control=1" arguments on the thinkpad\_acpi modprobe.
To properly configure this on a Debian system edit
`/etc/modprobe.d/thinkpad_acpi.modprobe`.

    x61:~% grep fan /etc/modprobe.d/thinkpad_acpi.modprobe
    options thinkpad_acpi hotkey=enable,0xffffbf experimental=1 fan_control=1

Since the Thinkpad embedded fan controller is a bit dumb ass, you unfortunately need to run your own [fan controller script.](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ACPI_fan_control_script)

To monitor temperature I use [yacpi](http://packages.qa.debian.org/y/yacpi.html) and have a look [how I use yacpi with my window manager](http://svn.natalian.org/home/.xsession) ([screenshot](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2352/2126792512_673714db8a_o.png)). Also I use [root-tail](http://packages.qa.debian.org/r/root-tail.html) to see what `tp-fancontrol` is doing by logging messages to my background.

## Bluetooth for dialup Internet (life changing)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2291201762/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2336/2291201762_e2f6c012da_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="(Bluetooth) Internet at Heathrow" /></a>

Configured with the help of this [bluetooth dialup Internet
guide](http://davesource.com/Solutions/20070520.T-Mobile-Nokia-E65-Ubuntu-Linux.html).

Bluetooth is fantastic as it allows me to use dial up networking (DUN) of my [Nokia E65](http://natalian.org/archives/2007/05/15/nokia-e65-from-3/) to connect to the Internet with 3G. :)

* [my three.co.uk peers config](http://static.natalian.org/2008-02-25/peers.tar) invoked by a `sudo pppd call gprs` (not the debian way with `pon` mind)

## Suspend

Radically reduce boot times by issuing `sudo s2ram -f -a 3` instead of `sudo
halt`. Works great. Need to lock the screen with something like `slock`
beforehand mind. Would be great to study if power is consumed.

Btw in suspend you'll see the crescent moon symbol light.

It seems to work 2 out of 3 times on my current 2.6.26 configuration... :/

## SD card reader not working (solved)

You need to [load the **mmc_block** and **sdhci** modules manually in
/etc/modules](http://svn.natalian.org/debian/configuration/x61/modules) for
some reason and also checkout my
[fstab](http://svn.natalian.org/debian/configuration/x61/fstab) to see how I
mount typically my camera's SD card on `/mnt/sd`.

	x61:~% mount | grep mmc
	/dev/mmcblk0p1 on /mnt/sd type vfat (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,user=hendry)
	x61:~% df -h | grep mmc
	/dev/mmcblk0p1        3.8G   32K  3.8G   1% /mnt/sd

Good news! The X61 supports my new 4G [SDHC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital_card#SDHC) card:

	Apr  9 14:19:49 x61 kernel: mmc0: new SDHC card at address e624

And the SDHC card works in my "Canon IXUS 950 IS" camera.

## Unplugged power consumption ~16W

According to [powertop](http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/powertop/) **long
term: 17.0W,/4.2h** on the biggest 8 cell battery. My X40 by comparison could
run as low as 10W for extended periods, though its 8 cell battery is old.

The wireless driver `iwl3945` seems to cause wakeups, though I am not even
using it. Very dissapointing. The wifi switch is not very useful as it also
switches off bluetooth. [When I am out and about I like to switch off wifi and
just use bluetooth to access the Internet on trains for example.](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/2278783255/)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2276263687/" title="Bios update .... I'm scared by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2258/2276263687_ff5a4578e4_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Bios update .... I'm scared" /></a>

I get this message on 2.6.23 or 2.6.24 kernels with Bios: 1.06 (7NET25WW)

    Message from syslogd@x61 at Tue Jan 15 11:28:42 2008 ...

    Disabling IRQ #21

This is a Lenovo problem that is fixed in their BIOS update as the changelog:

    (Fix) Unexpected interrupts from the USB controller may occur. (BIOS)

I created a [bootable USB stick using approach 4 from
Thinkwiki](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_Upgrade/X_Series#Approach_4:_Alternative_method_to_the_above_.22alternative_method.22)
and [Lenovo's ISO update for the
X61](http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-67983).

I tried to `dd` my USB stick to an image file to share this upgrade resource.
However `dd` creates an image 2G large which `bzip2` is unable to radically
downsize for sharing. :(

## Screen brightness

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2200147798/" title="High brightness by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2223/2200147798_2d9bacbbd5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="High brightness" /></a>

In the BIOS I've ramped up the brightness. I think this Lenovo option is a
little silly. I wish they just fitted a decent LCD panel. Current thinkpad
screens are dim and have poor viewing angles compared to competitors. :(

## Other concerns

Definitely areas of improvement are:

* The top side of the lid **hole** [see note](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2125072622/) - reader informs me this is where bluetooth is installed
* the ThinkVantage panel weakness - very tacky
* Why the wireless switch and what about Fn+F5?
* needless cardbus/pcmcia slot - who uses this?
* remove the firewall port and add one more USB port (3 is an improvement from 2 of the X40)
* Remove the Windows keys (waste of space) or perhaps remove the Fn key?
* The mouse buttons are sadly not as solid as those on the X40 - the Thinkpad thankfully is the only laptop I can think of with a dedicated middle/third mouse button, which is very nice for X users.
* stories of the keyboard scratching the screen (doesn't affect my model)
* fingerprint reader. wtf actually uses this? remove it or make it more integrated with hardware (see not about hard drive encryption below)
* the XGA screen is just terrible compared to almost any other laptop out there. Too dim and surely you could give us a SXGA option? Please?
* The [new power standard](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ahui/1112918474/). What a feck up! Many companies such as [Google have setup their conference rooms with the old Thinkpad PSU style](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2062844429/). Since Lenovo has changed it, it has really pissed off people including myself. Lenovo's excuse is that Intels require more power. This is a laptop computer, laptops should be using LESS POWER, not more!

### Lenovo's poor international warranty & customer service

Since this Thinkpad X61 was bought in the states, it seems to only have a
[warranty for the
USA.](http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/warrantyLookup.do?type=7675&serial=LV-F6040&warrantySubmit2.x=21&warrantySubmit2.y=10&country=897&iws=off&sitestyle=lenovo) :(

This is poor because when I bought my previous Thinkpad X40 in Korea, I had
world wide **onsite** warranty included. No extra charge. I used it whilst
travelling and generally had some excellent IBM support people service my X41's
laptop hard drive which crashed a couple of times ...

Also when you buy an Apple Macbook in the states, you'll have warranty in the
UK (ok, this can depend).

**Worldwide warranty is professional and what IBM thinkpad owners expect.**

Ricardo also writes in to say:

	I have only the portuguese warranty, no international one, and, to my
	disappointment, here you can't buy the extended care warranty, the one that
	protects from spills and drops... Lenovo is really a bit worse than IBM.

### Innovate ffs Lenovo

Lenovo's innovation is very poor. A good feature that some good engineers could
figure out is hardware encryption. So I don't have to mess about applying
encryption as software for my hard drive partitions and suffer the overhead for
doing so.

UPDATE: <a
href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption_(FDE))">Full Disk
Encryption</a> is the answer to my prayers. Thank you Lenovo. Now just make
your computers cheaper now please. An EEEPC 1000 Atom based machine isn't far
off an X61 and 1/5 of the price here in the UK!
