I hate compiling my own kernels and always opt for Debian stock kernels.


I have got everything working except :

Hibernate/suspend which I don't really need.

A T30 with a new full battery can only expect to get about 2 hours of life. Pretty lame. Still useful in a UPS capacity.

I have not bothered to configure the power button to shutdown the machine.

The CISCO wireless card is a bit dissapointing. I can't it to work! :(
