I would prefer not to do it this way. I have to figure out hotplug.
Beware of the dc2xx driver, you need to remove it for it all to work!

 bilbo:~# lsmod | grep dc2
 dc2xx                   3232   0  (unused)
 usbcore                56384   1  [dc2xx usbmouse usb-uhci hid]
 bilbo:~# rmmod dc2xx

Fix the permissions:

 bilbo:/proc/bus/usb/001# chmod -R 777 003

Download them with gphoto2:

 hendry@bilbo:/tmp$ gphoto2 --port usb: -P

Or visually I can suggest gtkam under gnome, or setting up the camera in KDE and using the strange url, camera:/ in Konq!
