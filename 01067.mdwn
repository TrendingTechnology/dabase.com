Very denying X dening permission to users by default. Fix is:

 from memory, xwrapper is change the first line in /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config to have "allowed_users=console" instead of "allowed_users=rootonly", or dpkg-reconfigure xserver-common

Then how the hell do I get ion running? Nothing in the docs. In the end I was told:

 update-alternatives --config x-window-manager
