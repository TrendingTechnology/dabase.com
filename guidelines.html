  <h2 id="overview">Introduction</h2>
  <p>This document provide a set of guidelines for writing test cases that can be run effectively across devices, in particular on mobile devices.</p>

  <h3>Existing work</h3>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-acdi-20030901/">Authoring Challenges for Device Independence</a> explore these different limitations in the general context of writing device independent content, and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/">Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0</a> give specific guidance on writing content targeted at mobile devices.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/guidelines.html">CSS2.1 Test Case Authoring Guidelines</a> give some guidance on how to write test cases, and sets device-independence as a goal. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/svgTest-manual.htm#TestReviewGuidelines">SVG Test Suite Manual</a> also offers advices on writing test cases.</p>

  <p>Inspired by this existing work, and based on the experience gathered by the Mobile Web Test Suites Working Group while reviewing test cases and their fitness to mobile devices, this document explores the specific aspects to take into account when writing test cases to ensure greater device independence.</p>


  <h3>Devices limitations</h3>

  <p>When designing device-independent test cases, it is important to take into account the following parameters that imply some limitations on some devices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Screen</li>
    <li>Memory available</li>
    <li>Network bandwidth, latency and cost</li>
    <li>CPU power</li>
    <li>Extensions capabilities</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For tests that require interaction (either for running the test or for submitting results), the following parameters are also likely to matter:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keyboard access and ease of use</li>
    <li>Pointing device access</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Target devices</h3>
  <p>Trying to take into account all the possible constraints of all possible devices would make writing device-independent tests impossible.</p>
  <p>The first step towards writing device-independent test cases is thus to determine the range of devices on which the test cases would need or are likely to be run. To make that assessment:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>if the technology is already deployed, consider on what devices it is running</li>
    <li>if the technology can only be deployed on devices with a certain level of hardware characteristics, adapt the constraints in the guidelines below to that level</li>
    <li>if it is not possible to create a single test that will work well across devices, consider creating several versions of the test, or using server-based content adaptation to adapt it based on the requesting devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In any case, it is always a good idea to document in the test suites what are the minimal expected requirements to run the tests, and possibly which test cases require a certain level of support.</p>

  <h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>

  <h3>Screen limitations</h3>

  <p>Screen size matters when designing visual test cases - e.g. where the tester needs to assess whether the rendering of a test cases matches a reference rendering.</p>

  <p>Across devices, the following screen parameters vary widely:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>screen resolution</li>
    <li>zooming capability, scrolling</li>
    <li>physical dimensions</li>
    <li>number of colors</li>
    <li>contrast</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In general, to avoid problems when running test across devices:</p>
  <ol class='guidelines'>
    <li>Avoid tests based on absolute dimensions, or provide several versions for different screen resolutions</li>
    <li>Keep non-essential content off the top of the rendered content to avoid scrolling</li>
    <li>Be as concise as possible in the test description to avoid scrolling</li>
    <li>When using colors to express the result of the test, convey the result also with text.</li>
    <li>On color-based tests, use well-contrasted colors for parts that need to be distinguished.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Memory limitations</h3>

  <p>To avoid hitting memory limitations of the devices on which the technology under test run:</p>
  <ol class='guidelines'>
    <li>Keep the number of style sheets, images, objects or scripts to a minimum.</li>
    <li>On markup based documents, keep the document object model (DOM) tree as small as possible.</li>
    <li>Keep the number of data structure created dynamically (e.g. by scripts) to a minimum.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Network bandwidth, latency and cost</h3>

  <p>The characteristics of network access across devices vary greatly, in particular in terms of bandwidth available, the latency induced by network requests, and the cost of transferring content over the network.</p>

  <p>To cater for test environments where network is slow or costly:</p>
  <ol class='guidelines'>
    <li>Keep the number of external resources loaded along with the test case to a minimum; prefer including the content (e.g. using internal style sheets instead of external ones) rather than loading it, except if it can be cached and re-used across test cases.</li>
    <li>Keep the number of network requests originated from scripts to a minimum.</li>
    <li>Take care when triggering DOM operations that they will not require downloading DTD.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>CPU power</h3>
  <p>CPU-intensive operations on mobile devices drain the battery, and are likely to be much slower than on larger hardware. As a result:</p>
  <ol class='guidelines'>
    <li>Avoid unneeded images processing operations, such as scaling up or down raster images.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Extension capabilities</h3>
  <p>Most mobile devices have limited capabilities when it comes to plugins, additional fonts, or software extensions in general. As a result:</p>
  <ol class="guidelines">
    <li>Avoid relying on effects based on specific fonts.</li>
    <li>Avoid tests that rely on a specific plugin to be installed.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Keyboard access</h3>
  <p>Many mobile devices don't provide a full keyboard, and thus require several key press to enter a given character.</p>
  <ol class="guidelines">
    <li>Don't require long text entries from the testers.</li>
  </ol>


  <h3>Pointing devices</h3>
  <p>Many mobile devices don't provide a pointing device, making it difficult or impossible to activate specific portions of the rendered content.</p>
